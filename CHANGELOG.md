---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-01

### ✨ Highlights

- **Standardized API Response Envelope** — All endpoints return a consistent `{success, data, meta}` format with typed error classes
- **Abstract File Storage** — Repository pattern decouples services from the filesystem
- **Blocked Task Status** — Full support for blocked tasks across MCP, CLI, and board

### Added

#### Standardize API Response Envelope (#2)

- 4 new error classes: `UnauthorizedError`, `ForbiddenError`, `BadRequestError`, `InternalError` (in `middleware/error-handler.ts`)
- `sendPaginated(res, items, {page, limit, total})` helper for pagination metadata in envelope
- Response envelope format:
  - Success: `{success: true, data, meta: {timestamp, requestId}}`
  - Error: `{success: false, error: {code, message, details?}, meta}`
  - Pagination: `meta` includes `{page, limit, total, totalPages}` on paginated endpoints

#### Abstract File Storage (#6)

- 5 new repository interfaces: `ActivityRepository`, `TemplateRepository`, `StatusHistoryRepository`, `ManagedListRepository`, `TelemetryRepository`
- `StorageProvider` extended with new repositories
- `fs-helpers.ts` — centralized filesystem access (only file that imports `fs`)

#### Blocked Task Status (#32)

- MCP tools Zod/JSON schema definitions updated for blocked status
- MCP active tasks filter updated to include blocked
- CLI help text updated
- CLI status color: blocked = red

### Changed

- All 11 route files standardized — zero ad-hoc `{error: "..."}` patterns
- Auth middleware errors standardized to use typed error classes
- All 10 services migrated off direct `fs` imports to use `fs-helpers.ts`

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-31

### ✨ Highlights

- **Built-in Chat Interface** — Talk to AI agents directly from the board or any task, with streaming responses and markdown rendering
- **Agent Routing Engine** — Tasks auto-route to the best available agent based on type, project, and capabilities
- **Agent Selection on Task Creation** — Choose which agent handles a task when you create it
- **Hardened Infrastructure** — Rate limiting, circuit breakers, file locking, request timeouts, data integrity checks, and more

### Added

#### Chat Interface (#18)

- Full chat panel accessible from any task or the board header
- Streaming AI responses with real-time WebSocket delivery
- Floating chat bubble with pulse indicator for new messages
- Chat sessions stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Gateway integration for AI responses via Clawdbot
- Chat export as markdown (download icon in header)
- Clear chat history with confirmation dialog
- Mode toggle: Ask (read-only queries) vs Build (changes, files, commands)
- Keyboard shortcut support
- Auto-focus input after sending messages
- Tool call display with expandable input/output sections

#### Agent Routing Engine (#16)

- Task-aware routing that matches tasks to agents by type, project, and capabilities
- Routing rules configurable per agent in Settings → Agents
- API endpoints for routing queries and rule management
- Full test coverage (17 tests)

#### Agent Selection on Task Creation (#17)

- Agent dropdown in the Create Task dialog
- Auto-routes to best agent based on task type, or allows manual override
- Agent field displayed in task metadata section

#### Agent CRUD Management

- Full Add/Edit/Remove for agents in Settings → Agents
- Add Agent form with name, type slug (auto-generated), command, and args
- Edit/Remove via inline icons (default agent protected from deletion)
- `AgentType` loosened from fixed enum to any string slug — fully custom agents

#### Board Filter: Agent

- Filter board by assigned agent in the FilterBar
- Agent indicator dots on task cards match filter state

#### Infrastructure & Security

- **Rate Limiting** — Per-route tiered thresholds (auth, API reads, writes, uploads)
- **Circuit Breaker** — Automatic failure detection for external service calls with configurable thresholds
- **File Locking** — FIFO queue prevents race conditions on concurrent file writes
- **Request Timeouts** — Middleware kills hung connections before they pile up
- **Data Integrity** — Hash-chain verification + automatic backup on startup with rotation
- **Audit Log** — Immutable hash-chain audit trail for sensitive operations
- **Health Endpoint** — Liveness, readiness, and deep checks (storage, disk, task file)
- **API Envelope** — Standardized `{ success, data, meta }` response format across all endpoints
- **Schema Validation** — Zod schemas on all mutating API routes
- **Metrics** — Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint for monitoring
- **WebSocket Heartbeat** — Connection keep-alive with automatic reconnection and connection limits
- **Error Boundaries** — React error boundaries with graceful fallback UI
- **Dependency Audit** — Automated vulnerability scanning in CI

#### Storage & Architecture

- Abstract file storage behind repository interface (prep for future database backends)
- Structured logging with pino (replaced all `console.*` calls)

#### First-Run Experience

- Example tasks auto-populate the board on first run (4 sample tasks)
- Manual seed script: `pnpm seed`
- Task data `.gitignore`d — your data stays private

#### Dark/Light Mode

- Settings → General → Appearance toggle (moon/sun icon)
- Persists to localStorage; default is dark mode
- Inline script prevents flash of wrong theme on load

#### UI Theme

- Primary color: purple (`270° 50% 40%`) with white text
- Focus rings, switches, and accents updated to match

#### Documentation

- TROUBLESHOOTING.md with common issues and solutions
- Comprehensive FEATURES.md reference
- Agentic AI Safety best practices guide
- Roadmap section linking to v1.1 milestone
- Competitive comparison table
- OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot/Clawdbot) attribution updated

#### Per-Status Selection (#24)

- Select All checkbox per column header
- Toolbar buttons for bulk operations scoped to selected status
- Column checkboxes for quick multi-select

### Fixed

- **Chat delete not clearing UI** — React Query kept stale cached data after session file was deleted; now uses `removeQueries` to nuke cache
- **Chat send broken after delete** — Server now recreates task-scoped sessions instead of throwing 404
- **Cross-column drag-and-drop** — Tasks reliably move between columns with local state management during drag
- **Dashboard agent comparison** — Fixed broken data fetch (raw `fetch` → `apiFetch` for envelope unwrapping)
- **Dashboard drill-down** — Removed duplicate X button, fixed focus ring clipping, wired up `open-task` event
- **Localhost auth rate limit** (#25) — Exempted localhost from rate limiting
- **Numeric inputs** — Clean inputs without browser spinners (#19)
- **Timer start/stop** — Optimistic UI toggle + cache patch for instant feedback
- **Task cache fragmentation** — All routes now use TaskService singleton
- **Sprint/Agent label alignment** — Fixed form layout in task detail panel
- **Sticky header** — Fixed positioning + matched indicator dot sizes
- **Keyboard test infinite loop** — Resolved render loop in `useKeyboard` + memoized context
- **Agent idle timeout** — Increased from 5 to 15 minutes to reduce false resets
- **File lock ordering** — Added in-process FIFO queue for deterministic write ordering
- **Search filters** — Added task ID to board and archive search

### Changed

- Agent status popover: moved idle description to bottom, added activity history link
- WebSocket indicator: click popover with connection status explanation
- Dashboard layout: Daily Activity (75%) + Recent Status Changes (25%) side-by-side
- Rolling average line: cyan-teal to contrast purple theme
- Bar chart hover: subtle muted fill instead of white flash
- All repo links updated to BradGroux (primary repo)
- All contact emails standardized to contact@digitalmeld.io
- Test suite: 72 files, **1,270 tests** (up from 61 files / 1,143 tests)
