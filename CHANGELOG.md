# Changelog

All notable changes to Veritas Kanban are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Agent CRUD Management

- Full Add/Edit/Remove for agents in Settings → Agents
- Add Agent form with name, type slug (auto-generated), command, and args
- Edit Agent: inline edit name, command, and args via pencil icon
- Remove Agent: trash icon with confirmation dialog (blocked for the default agent)
- `AgentType` loosened from a fixed enum (`claude-code | amp | copilot | gemini | veritas`) to any string slug — users can define completely custom agents

#### First-Run Seed Data

- Example tasks auto-populate the board on first run (4 sample tasks showcasing features)
- Manual seed script: `pnpm seed` (copies examples when board is empty)
- Task data (`tasks/active/`, `tasks/archive/`) is `.gitignore`d — your data stays private
- Attachment directories excluded from git tracking

#### Dark/Light Mode Toggle

- Settings → General → Appearance section with toggle switch (moon/sun icon)
- Persists to localStorage; default is dark mode
- Inline script in `index.html` prevents flash of wrong theme on page load

#### UI Theme

- Primary color changed to purple (`270° 50% 40%`) with white text in dark mode
- Focus rings updated to purple
- Switch toggle thumbs: white in dark mode, black in light mode

### Fixed

#### Cross-Column Drag-and-Drop

- Tasks can now be dragged between Kanban columns reliably
- Added local state management during drag for real-time column updates
- Custom collision detection using `pointerWithin` with `rectIntersection` fallback
- Tooltips suppressed during drag operations to prevent interference

#### Dashboard

- Agent Comparison chart: fixed broken data fetch — replaced raw `fetch()` with `apiFetch()` to properly unwrap the API response envelope
- Rolling average line: changed from purple to vibrant cyan-teal to contrast new purple theme
- Bar chart hover cursor: changed from white flash to subtle muted fill
- Drill-down panels: removed duplicate X close button
- Drill-down focus rings: changed to `ring-inset` to prevent clipping at panel edges
- Dashboard section `overflow-hidden`: now only applies when the section is collapsed
- StatusTimeline: redesigned to Daily Activity (75%) + Recent Status Changes (25%) side-by-side layout
- `open-task` event: wired up so clicking tasks in drill-down panels opens the task detail panel (with API fallback for deleted tasks)
